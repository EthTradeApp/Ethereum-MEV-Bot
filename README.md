# Ethereum-MEV-Bot

A Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot that scans the Ethereum mempool for profitable transactions and executes them to capture arbitrage, frontrunning, and liquidation opportunities.

## Overview

This bot is primarily written in JavaScript (75.1%) with some Solidity (24.9%) smart contracts. It monitors pending Ethereum transactions in real-time, analyzes them for MEV opportunities, and submits profitable bundles via Flashbots or directly to the mempool.

## Features

- Real-time mempool scanning for profitable MEV transactions  
- Support for common MEV strategies: arbitrage, frontrunning, sandwich attacks  
- Integration with Flashbots for private bundle submission  
- Gas price optimization and transaction simulation  
- Solidity contracts to execute atomic arbitrage and liquidation  
- Configurable for Ethereum mainnet and testnets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+) and npm installed  
- An Ethereum node endpoint (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, or your own) with WebSocket support  
- Flashbots access (optional but recommended)  
- Wallet private key with ETH for gas fees  
- Basic familiarity with Ethereum transactions and smart contracts

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/EthTradeApp/Ethereum_MEV_Bot.git
cd Ethereum_MEV_Bot
npm install

text

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example` and fill in your credentials:

HTTPS_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
WSS_URL=wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
CHAIN_ID=1
BLOCKNATIVE_TOKEN=your_blocknative_api_key
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
SIGNING_KEY=your_flashbots_signing_key
BOT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address

text

### Running the Bot

Start the bot with:

npm run start

text

The bot will connect to the Ethereum mempool, analyze transactions, and attempt to capture MEV opportunities.

## How It Works

1. **Mempool Monitoring:** Listens to pending transactions via WebSocket.  
2. **Opportunity Detection:** Simulates transactions to identify arbitrage, liquidation, or frontrunning chances.  
3. **Bundle Creation:** Constructs transaction bundles with your MEV smart contracts.  
4. **Submission:** Sends bundles to Flashbots or the public mempool for inclusion in the next block.
